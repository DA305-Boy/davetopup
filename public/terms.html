      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>Last updated: November 27, 2025</p>

      <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Dave TopUp website, platform, storefronts, services, and related applications (collectively the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or use the Service.</p>

      <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
      <p>"Platform" or "Service" means the Dave TopUp website and any subdomains, mobile apps, and hosted storefronts. "Seller" or "Store Owner" means a user who creates and operates a Store on the Platform to offer digital goods or top-ups. "Buyer" or "Customer" means a user who purchases items from a Store. "You" refers to any user of the Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>To use the Service you must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (typically 18). By registering you represent that you meet this eligibility requirement. If you register on behalf of an entity, you represent you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>

      <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
      <p>When creating an account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use. We are not liable for losses due to unauthorized use of your account unless caused by our gross negligence.</p>

      <h2>4. Store Creation and Multi‑Tenant Hosting</h2>
      <p>The Platform allows users to create Stores to sell digital goods or top-ups to Buyers. As a Store Owner you are responsible for all content, offerings, pricing, and legal compliance of your Store. You retain ownership of the intellectual property in content you upload, but you grant the Platform a non-exclusive license to host and display that content to provide the Service.</p>

      <h2>5. Payments, Fees, and Payouts</h2>
      <p>The Platform integrates with third‑party payment processors (such as Stripe, PayPal) to process payments. By using payment services you agree to the terms and privacy policies of the payment processors. Sellers may be charged platform fees, processing fees, or other fees; these fees and the payout schedule will be disclosed in the Seller dashboard. Sellers are responsible for any taxes, reporting, and legal requirements in their jurisdictions.</p>

      <h2>6. Stripe Connect and Marketplace Payments</h2>
      <p>For multi-store marketplace flows, the Platform may use Stripe Connect to facilitate payments and payouts to Store Owners. Onboarding via Stripe Connect may require uploading identity documents and bank details. Stripe's terms and verification process apply. The Platform is not responsible for delays or holds imposed by Stripe due to verification issues.</p>

      <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <p>Users must not use the Service to engage in illegal activity, fraud, intellectual property infringement, or distribution of stolen or unauthorized game accounts or content. Prohibited activities include but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sale of stolen accounts, unauthorized access credentials, or illegal goods;</li>
        <li>Using the Service to launder funds or conduct fraud;</li>
        <li>Impersonation or misrepresentation of affiliation;</li>
        <li>Uploading malware or content that violates privacy or hate-speech policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Refunds, Cancellations and Disputes</h2>
      <p>Refund policies may vary by Store. Buyers should review each Store's refund policy before purchase. The Platform may facilitate dispute resolution and, where appropriate, may issue holds or reversals based on payment processor rules or evidence of fraud. The Platform reserves the right to withhold payouts pending investigation.</p>

      <h2>9. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
      <p>The Platform and its content (logos, designs, text, software) are protected by copyright and other IP rights. Sellers grant the Platform a limited license to host Display and distribute their Store content solely for the purpose of operating the Service. Sellers must not upload content that infringes third-party rights.</p>

      <h2>10. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
      <p>Our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and share personal data. By using the Service you consent to the collection and processing of data as described in the Privacy Policy. Store Owners are responsible for obtaining any consents required for their customers in accordance with applicable law.</p>

      <h2>11. Security and PCI Compliance</h2>
      <p>The Platform does not store full card numbers or CVC values. Payment processing is handled by PCI‑compliant third‑party processors such as Stripe. Sellers and Buyers must follow security best practices. We recommend enabling two‑factor authentication (2FA) for accounts with payout access. The Platform implements industry standard TLS for data in transit; however, no system is perfectly secure and you use the Service at your own risk.</p>

      <h2>12. Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither the Platform nor its affiliates will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or related to the Service. Our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the total amount paid to the Platform by the affected party in the prior six (6) months.</p>

      <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Platform and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising from your violation of these Terms or your misuse of the Service.</p>

      <h2>14. Moderation, Suspension and Termination</h2>
      <p>The Platform reserves the right to remove content, suspend or terminate accounts at any time for violations of these Terms, suspected fraud, or legal reasons. Payouts may be held pending investigation. Termination will not relieve you of obligations incurred prior to termination.</p>

      <h2>15. External Links and Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>The Service may contain links to third‑party websites and services. We do not endorse and are not responsible for third‑party content, products, or practices. Third‑party services (payment gateways, hosting, communications) are governed by their own terms.</p>

      <h2>16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in our Company information, without regard to conflict of law principles. Disputes that cannot be resolved informally will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in that jurisdiction.</p>

      <h2>17. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email or by posting a prominent notice on the Service. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

      <h2>18. Contact Information</h2>
